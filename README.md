# Time_Series_Final_Project
Final Project for Time Series Modeling at 

Wow, this project was a while ago and I haven't kept it up to date on github. The project was finished and I got a 80- something on the project. Despite having pretty accurate predictions.
Unfortunatley I reset my computer and lost all my files. Luckily I was able to scrape together a couple tidbits from Canvas including the final paper and some baseline arima models.
